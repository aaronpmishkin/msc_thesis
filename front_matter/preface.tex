\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was conceived and written solely by the author, Aaron Mishkin. 
The basis for the theoretical work was developed in collaboration with Sharan Vaswani and Frederik Kunstner over the last two years.
The results presented are original, unpublished work with the exception of \autoref{thm:non-convex-line-search}, which was published in \citet{vaswani2019painless}.

The extension of interpolation to general stochastic oracles in \autoref{ch:interpolation-gc} was conducted by the author alone, while the connection between interpolation and weak/strong growth was developed in collaboration with S. Vaswani, and F. Kunstner. 
The improved convergence theorems in Chapters~\ref{ch:sgd} and~\ref{ch:acceleration} build on previous work by \citet{vaswani2019fast} and were proved solely by the author.  
Similarly, \autoref{ch:line-search} presents original improvements of existing work by \citet{vaswani2019painless}, of which Aaron Mishkin is an author, with the exception of \autoref{thm:non-convex-line-search} as noted above.
The proof technique for \autoref{thm:non-convex-line-search} was developed by S. Vaswani, while the specific result was proved by the author. 
\autoref{ch:beyond-interpolation} is all original work by Aaron Mishkin. 

All figures are the original product of the author, Aaron Mishkin.
