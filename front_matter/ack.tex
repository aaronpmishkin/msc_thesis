\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I am extremely grateful to my supervisor, Mark Schmidt, for fostering an intellectually curious and collaborative environment.
His group at the University of British Columbia has been an \( \epsilon \)-optimal setting for this research.
Sharan Vaswani convinced me to join the world of stochastic optimization in 2018 and none of the work herein would have come to be without his support.
I am also greatly indebted to my friend and colleague Frederik Kunstner, with whom I have shared innumerable conversations on interpolation and stochastic gradient descent. 
Finally, Si Yi (Cathy) Meng, Betty Shea, and Jonathan Lavington have provided many excellent comments and suggestions throughout the development of this thesis.
